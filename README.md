# WashingtonFishHarvest
Fishing is one of the few things my dad and I bond over. Washington, being the perfect near-ocean state, would be a great candidate in analyzing the types of fish and the population trends of those fish breeds.

I've downloaded the public access data of fish harvest record from 1974 to 2012 on [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/washington-anadromous-fish-harvest-data-1974-2012)

I then skimmed through the data to see what I can answer with this dataset with the following columns:
>Year

>Fisher Type (Sport, Treaty, or non-Treaty).

>Fish Type (Chinook, Coho, Chum, Pink, Sockeye, Steelhead, Jacks)

>Total amount by fisher type

>Total amount by the year

## Questions
1. Are fishes available each year declining from overharvesting?
2. What is the difference between treaty catcher and non-treaty catcher?
3. Which specie is more sustainable/ caught the most each year?

## Hypothesis
I've notice that seafood prices in general have been increasing in the sound which suggests the availability of seafood is decreasing over the years from overharvesting and not allowing the population to regenerate back to a health threshold. So I would expect to see a decrease in all species of fish harvested.

## Analysis

First let's see the total amount of fish caught per year throughout the timeline.
